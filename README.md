# Fateprdictor
FatePredictor, a novel computational framework grounded in bifurcation theory, optimal transport theory, and deep learning, to reconstruct the dynamic trajectories of cellular systems and predict cell fate decision-making based on single-cell data.
  The advantages of our FatePredictor can be outlined as follows. Firstly, FatePredictor is an initial effort to integrate dynamic systems theory with ensemble deep learning models for predicting bifurcation points in complex biological processes, such as cell fate decision-making. Secondly, the proposed FatePredictor surpasses conventional methods with its exceptional precision in predicting cell fate decision-making events and identifying distinct types of bifurcations within biological systems. Thirdly, our model efficiently highlights the gene sets driving bifurcation events and reveals the pathways crucial to key cellular processes, providing essential guidance for designing interventions and timing strategies to steer the systemâ€™s evolution from dysfunction to a healthy condition. 
  Besides, FatePredictor exhibits outstanding performance across a variety of biological datasets, accurately pinpointing critical transition and highlighting its applicability to broader tissue-level contexts. Hence, FatePredictor introduces an innovative framework for predicting cell fate decision-making, distinguished by its efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, with strong potential for real-world applications.# Fateprdictor-code
